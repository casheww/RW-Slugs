# RW-Slugs
An unplanned set of BepInEx plugins for Rain World, each adding a new character based on [Slime_Cubed's SlugBase](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugBase).

I currently plan to release each slugcat as a separate mod so users can pick and choose... That's assuming I manage to think of ideas for more.

### Installation
Grab the DLLs from [here](https://github.com/casheww/RW-Slugs/releases/latest) and install as you would any Rain World BepInEx plugin.
Requires [SlugBase](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugBase/releases/latest)!
